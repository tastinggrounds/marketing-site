When talking coffee with my friends, we’d often ask each other what we’d been drinking recently, how we had brewed it, and what flavors the coffee reminded us of. We were all in the pursuit of brewing and drinking the best coffee we possibly could. It was clear that life would be better if we could do all of this in one place.</p>\n          <figure className=\"AlignCenter\">\n            <img \n              className=\"CoffeeBagsImage\" \n              src={require(\"./coffee-bags.png\")} \n              alt=\"coffee bags\" \n            />\n              <figcaption>\n                <em>A small piece of my weird coffee bag collection.</em>\n              </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n          <p>I downloaded countless coffee apps in an attempt to solve this problem. Some nailed certain aspects of what I was looking for, some checked a few boxes but did so poorly, and others were simply so buggy that they were unusable. I pitched the idea to the best software engineer I knew (Patrick) and thus Tasting Grounds was born.</p>\n          <p>We are aiming to build a community for coffee beginners, aficionados, and experts to brew coffee together. With Tasting Grounds, you can log and rate your brews and tasting notes, explore what coffees other members of the community are drinking and what they are tasting, interact with your friends about their brews, and discover new roasters to love. We have many more features in the works to connect you more with the coffee community and to help you learn more about coffees, roasting, and brewing.</p>\n          <figure className=\"AlignCenter\">\n            <img \n              className=\"AppProfileImage\" \n              src={require(\"./app-profile.png\")} \n              alt=\"app profile\" \n            />\n              <figcaption>\n                <em>My much-improved coffee inventory, shared with my friends </em>😊\n              </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n          <p>We hope you love using Tasting Grounds as much as we do.

Pineapple?? Bubblegum??? Skittles????</p>\n        <p>We have seen some pretty wild flavor descriptors on some coffees recently and know that’s left a lot of people, especially those new to the specialty coffee world, wondering - flavors like that must have been added to the coffee, right? Coffee tastes like coffee, not like fruit or candy, right? WRONG, kind of.</p>\n        <p>There are many factors that contribute to the way that a coffee tastes, all of which we have worked to highlight at various points in the Tasting Grounds app. A coffee’s variety, origin, growing altitude, processing method, roast level, brewing method, brewing water, grind size, and more will all factor into the flavors of a coffee. But equally as important, if not more important, as those factors, is you. Your experiences with different tastes are going to have an enormous impact on the flavors that you perceive.</p>\n        <p>We think you should ask yourself this when it comes to flavor profile descriptors - <b><em>what does this coffee remind you of?</em></b></p>\n        <div className=\"AlignCenter\">\n          <img\n            className=\"FlavorProfileImage\" \n            src={\"https://production.cdntg.xyz/assets/marketing-site/flavor-wheel.webp\"}  \n            alt=\"coffee flavor wheel\" \n          />\n        </div>\n        <p>Flavor is a combination of what you are tasting and smelling - so don’t discount the impact aromatics have on the flavors a coffee may remind of you. Check out our <Link to=\"learn/tasting-notes\">Guide to Tasting Notes</Link> if you haven’t already for some factors to consider in how you perceive flavor.</p>\n        <p>Referencing a flavor wheel can be helpful when trying to describe what you are tasting. The flavor descriptors available on Tasting Grounds are roughly based on <a href=\"https://counterculturecoffee.com/learn/resource-center/coffee-tasters-flavor-wheel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Counter Culture’s Flavor Wheel</a>. We referenced this wheel as it represents many common flavors you will hear people use when describing coffee. To use the wheel, work from the center out to narrow down a specific flavor note.</p>\n        <p>Do not get discouraged if you can’t taste the same flavor profiles as those that the roaster puts on the bag! Everyone’s tastes are unique so the notes on the bag are only the reflection of what the roaster has experienced or the story they are trying to tell with the coffee.</p>\n        <p>If you find yourself struggling to pick out flavors after considering what you are reminded of, we’d definitely encourage you to try anything and everything to familiarize yourself with more flavors! Go grab one of each fruit at the store, especially the ones you’ve never seen or tried before. You can’t be reminded of a flavor you’ve never tasted before!</p>\n      </div>\n      <DownloadButtons />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';\n\nimport { Heading, DownloadButtons } from '../../../components';\n\nimport './LearnContentScreens.css';\n\nexport default function GrindSizesScreen() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"LearnContentScreensContainer\">\n      <Helmet>\n        <title>Guide to Coffee Grind Sizes | Tasting Grounds</title>\n        <meta \n          name=\"description\" \n          content=\"The Tasting Grounds coffee app guidelines for coffee grind sizes based on the brew method and recommended settings for Comandante C40, Timemore Chestnut, Fellow Ode, and Baratz Encore grinders.\" \n        />\n      </Helmet>\n      <Heading size={Heading.SIZES.XXLARGE}>Guide to Coffee Grind Sizes</Heading>\n      <div className=\"LearnContentSceensBodyContainer\">\n        <p>Grind size is one of the most important and easily-adjustable characteristics of your brew process.</p>\n        <div className=\"AlignCenter\">\n          <img\n            className=\"GrindSizeIcon\" \n            src={require(\"./Assets/grind-size-icon.png\")} \n            alt=\"grind size icon\" \n          />\n        </div>\n        <p>The primary impact grind size has on your brew is the surface area of the coffee grounds which the water will be in contact with. A finer grind has a larger total surface area and will extract the coffee faster while a coarser grind will have a smaller surface area and will extract slower.</p>\n        <p>A secondary impact grind size has on your brew, particularly with percolation brewing methods (like a pour over or drip), is resistance as the water flows through the grounds. A finer grind will slow the flow rate of the water and increase the level of extraction while a coarser will have a faster flow rate and a less extraction.</p>\n        <p>Striking the right balance of surface area and resistance will make a huge difference in your resulting cup. When it comes to tracking your grind size in Tasting Grounds, it is difficult to account for the different settings on the many different grinders out there in a way that is useful to you and your friends in the community.

Body? Sweetness? …it all tastes like coffee! Don’t sweat it. We’re going to explain a little bit about what you should be thinking about when it comes to different coffee tasting notes.</p>\n        <p>In the Tasting Grounds app, we  give you five tasting characteristics to rate on a scale of 1-5 (at 0.5 increments). \n          Why didn’t we mirror the SCA cupping form you ask? We hoped to create a good balance of simplicity for those who are less experienced and untrained, yet detailed enough for those who have tasted and scored many coffees.</p>\n        <p>One important thing to keep in mind when using this scale is that you are NOT scoring “How (enter tasting note here) is this coffee?”\n           - you are scoring the quality of the tasting notes. For example - there might have been a time that you’ve had a piece of cake that was just too sweet for you.\n            You wouldn’t rate that a 5 on sweetness just because it was extremely sweet, you might rate it lower because it was unpleasantly sweet.</p>\n        <p>If you still find yourself confused about how to identify these qualities in a coffee after reading this, we’d highly suggest you try cupping multiple coffees side-by-side. \n          Comparing unique coffees will really help you pick apart the nuances in coffee characteristics.</p>\n        <br />\n        <Heading size={Heading.SIZES.SMALL}>Aromatics</Heading>\n        <p>Aromatics include the <b>Fragrance</b> and the <b>Aroma</b> of a coffee. <b>Fragrance</b> is the smell of the ground coffee when still dry and <b>Aroma</b> is the smell of the coffee when infused with hot water. \n        You can evaluate the fragrance by sniffing the grounds before pouring water onto the coffee. If you are cupping, there are two distinct phases where you can evaluate aroma. First, by sniffing the aromas released while breaking the crust and second, by sniffing the aromas released while the coffee steeps. If you aren’t cupping you might think of the first phase during the bloom and second as the next pour(s) - that all depends on your brew process. The rating you give should reflect the preference of each of the aromatic aspects of your coffee.</p>\n        <br />\n        <Heading size={Heading.SIZES.SMALL}>Body</Heading>\n        <p>Body can be thought of as the “weight” of the coffee. You can perceive it best between your tongue and the roof of your mouth. \n        You might often hear people talk about the “mouthfeel” when referring to the body of a coffee. Terms like watery, creamy, and buttery or light, full, and balanced when describing the body. A light body or a heavy body that is well suited to the coffee can each be considered pleasant and given a high score. </p>\n        <br />\n        <Heading size={Heading.SIZES.SMALL}>Acidity</Heading>\n        <p>Acidity can be the hardest to understand and most contentious tasting note in coffee. The spectrum of acidity is best spanned from “brightness” to “sourness”. There are many types of acids that contribute to flavors in coffee. Some of the most common to think about are:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><b>Acetic Acid</b> - will remind you of sour, fermenty flavors like vinegar. Typically this will be considered favorable in small amounts, but will be unpleasant when stronger</li>\n          <li><b>Citric Acid</b> - you can probably guess this one! It will remind of you citrus fruit notes and possibly sourness if it is very strong</li>\n          <li><b>Malic Acid</b> - will be quite similar to citric acid, but the most common reminder of malic acid is the crispness, juiciness, and sourness of a green apple</li>\n          <li><b>Phosphoric Acid</b> - will be more closely associated with the sweetness or creaminess of the coffee. You might be reminded of cola or the combination of sweet and tart you get from berries apple</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>This is not a definitive list of acids that you’ll find in coffee, but it should give you some things to think about when evaluating acidity. Like with body, a high acidity coffee or a low acidity coffee can each be considered pleasant and given a high score.</p>\n        <br />\n        <Heading size={Heading.SIZES.SMALL}>Sweetness</Heading>\n        <p>Sweetness can obviously refer to sweetness in the terms you are familiar with, but it can also be the result of the perception of a fullness of flavor. Something that may help when it comes to thinking of sweetness is the opposite notes of sour, astringent, vegetal notes. Sweetness comes from sugars, glycols, alcohols, and amino acids in coffee. As a basic rule of thumb, a fruiter sweetness might come through in lighter roasts while caramelier, chocolatier sweetness comes in darker roasts. Each type of sweetness can be enjoyable and the rating should reflect how pleasing it is to you.</p>\n        <br />\n        <Heading size={Heading.SIZES.SMALL}>Aftertaste</Heading>\n        <p>Aftertaste is the length of positive taste and aroma of the coffee that remains on your palate after you’ve swallowed the coffee. You should think about how the flavors of the coffee linger. Typically, a shorter, unpleasant linger should get a lower score while a longer, positive linger should get a higher score for aftertaste.</p>\n        <br />\n      </div>\n      <DownloadButtons />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n","/* eslint-disable max-len */\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet';\n\nimport './LegalScreen.css';\n\nexport default function TermsScreen() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"LegalText\">\n      <Helmet>\n        <title>Terms of Use | Tasting Grounds</title>\n        <meta \n          name=\"description\" \n          content=\"Terms of Use for Tasting Grounds.
