When talking coffee with my friends, we’d often ask each other what we’d been drinking recently, how we had brewed it, and what flavors the coffee reminded us of. We were all in the pursuit of brewing and drinking the best coffee we possibly could. It was clear that life would be better if we could do all of this in one place.</p>\n        <figure className=\"AlignCenter\">\n          <img \n            className=\"CoffeeBagsImage\" \n            src={require(\"./coffee-bags.png\")} \n            alt=\"coffee bags\" \n          />\n            <figcaption>\n              <em>A small piece of my weird coffee bag collection.</em>\n            </figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <p>I downloaded countless coffee apps in an attempt to solve this problem. Some nailed certain aspects of what I was looking for, some checked a few boxes but did so poorly, and others were simply so buggy that they were unusable. I pitched the idea to the best software engineer I knew (Patrick) and thus Tasting Grounds was born.</p>\n        <p>We are aiming to build a community for coffee beginners, aficionados, and experts to brew coffee together. With Tasting Grounds, you can log and rate your brews and tasting notes, explore what coffees other members of the community are drinking and what they are tasting, interact with your friends about their brews, and discover new roasters to love. We have many more features in the works to connect you more with the coffee community and to help you learn more about coffees, roasting, and brewing.</p>\n        <figure className=\"AlignCenter\">\n          <img \n            className=\"AppProfileImage\" \n            src={require(\"./app-profile.png\")} \n            alt=\"app profile\" \n          />\n            <figcaption>\n              <em>My much-improved coffee inventory, shared with my friends </em>😊\n            </figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <p>We hope you love using Tasting Grounds as much as we do.

It is best and most helpful if you can enter as much information as accurately as possible, but do not worry if you don’t have all of the information handy.</p>\n        <p>A few things to keep in mind when creating roasters and coffees:</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>There are many roasters with similar names, so including either location or the website URL ensures that we can verify the roaster correctly.</li>\n            <li>There are certain details that we don’t make available when creating coffees and roasters. We will always fill these in ourselves, when the information is verifiable. Fields include descriptions, images, purchase URLs, etc.</li>\n            <li>We may modify or remove details entered if we find inaccuracies or cannot verify the information. This may include the names of coffees which are displayed in your brews (however we are not modifying any details of your brew).</li>\n            <li>Coffee names can be a tricky field, especially when it comes to single origin coffees that roasters often name based on their origins. Some standards we follow when naming:</li>\n              <ul>\n                <li>The main text of a coffee bag label - if it includes the origin or other details like the process, we will include it in the name field (it my be necessary to distinguish between a washed and naturally processed coffee of the same name).</li>\n                <li>The main label given to a coffee on the roaster’s website.</li>\n                <li>If the bag and website do not match exactly, we will favor the name on the bag.</li>\n              </ul>\n            <li>We don’t support every flavor note that you’re going to see roasters use. Our flavor selections are based on the <a href=\"https://counterculturecoffee.com/learn/resource-center/coffee-tasters-flavor-wheel\">Counter Culture flavor wheel</a>. We use this as it is well known and in our opinion, a fairly comprehensive wheel of common flavors coffees remind many people of. It also uses flavors that are known and accessible to many people - we don’t think flavor notes of rare and exotic fruits are very useful. If a flavor is referenced by the roaster that we do not have:</li>\n              <ul>\n                <li>We may select the closed similar flavor.</li>\n                <li>We may exclude the flavor note all together.</li>\n              </ul>\n          </ul>\n        <p>Have you found something inaccurate in our catalog, are we missing an option in any field that you want to see, or are you a roaster that wants to enter your own information?

A finer grind has a larger total surface area and will extract the coffee faster while a coarser grind will have a smaller surface area and will extract slower.</p>\n        <p>A secondary impact grind size has on your brew, particularly with percolation brewing methods (like a pour over or drip), is resistance as the water flows through the grounds. A finer grind will slow the flow rate of the water and increase the level of extraction while a coarser will have a faster flow rate and a less extraction.</p>\n        <p>Striking the right balance of surface area and resistance will make a huge difference in your resulting cup. When it comes to tracking your grind size in Tasting Grounds, it is difficult to account for the different settings on the many different grinders out there in a way that is useful to you and your friends in the community.
