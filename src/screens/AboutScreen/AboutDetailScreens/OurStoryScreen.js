        <p>In the descent from a coffee lover into a coffee-obsessed maniac, I started collecting a stack of coffee bags and scribbling difficult to read notes about each of my brews. When talking coffee with my friends, weâ€™d often ask each other what weâ€™d been drinking recently, how we had brewed it, and what flavors the coffee reminded us of. We were all in the pursuit of brewing and drinking the best coffee we possibly could. It was clear that life would be better if we could do all of this in one place.</p>

        <p>I downloaded countless coffee apps in an attempt to solve this problem. Some nailed certain aspects of what I was looking for, some checked a few boxes but did so poorly, and others were simply so buggy that they were unusable. I pitched the idea to the best software engineer I knew (Patrick) and thus Tasting Grounds was born.</p>
        <p>We are aiming to build a community for coffee beginners, aficionados, and experts to brew coffee together. With Tasting Grounds, you can log and rate your brews and tasting notes, explore what coffees other members of the community are drinking and what they are tasting, interact with your friends about their brews, and discover new roasters to love. We have many more features in the works to connect you more with the coffee community and to help you learn more about coffees, roasting, and brewing.</p>
